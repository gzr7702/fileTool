A gui that can be used to read, unzip (or untar), and report on different types of files. This comes out of the necessity to work with unknown file types
that clients send us at work. Instead of using the file and less commands, I made a GUI version to help people who aren't as technical accomplish the same thing. 


I chose to use Tkinter because it is easily available to anyone who is using Python and it's (relatively) easy to configure.

- fileTool.py, fileActions.py, standardActions.py

- Uses Tkinter and the Python version 2.7

= To install, you need to have Python 2.7 and make sure that Tkinter is working. Please go to http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter and follow the instructions on setting it up.
